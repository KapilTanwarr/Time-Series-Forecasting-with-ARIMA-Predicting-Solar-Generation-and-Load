# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-ARIMA-Predicting-Solar-Generation-and-Load
This project focuses on analyzing time-series data for solar generation and load, determining stationarity, and building ARIMA models to forecast future values. Below, Iâ€™ll explain each step, followed by a GitHub README and LinkedIn post content.

## Steps
1. **Load and Visualize Data**
   - Understand patterns in solar generation and load.

2. **Handle Missing Values**
   - Ensure continuity using forward fill.

3. **Check Stationarity**
   - Perform ADF tests to validate stationarity.

4. **Model Selection**
   - Use ACF and PACF plots to choose ARIMA parameters.

5. **Build ARIMA Models**
   - Train and test ARIMA models for accurate forecasting.

6. **Visualize Predictions**
   - Compare actual and predicted values.

## Key Results
- RMSE for Load: ~7715
- RMSE for Solar Generation: ~2486

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- statsmodels, scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run `time_series_forecasting.py`.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the power of time series forecasting in analyzing and predicting trends in real-world datasets. By leveraging the ARIMA model, I was able to successfully model the energy load and solar generation data, uncovering meaningful insights about daily and seasonal fluctuations. The process reinforced the importance of data preprocessing, stationarity testing, and appropriate model selection to achieve reliable results.

Through this project, I not only enhanced my technical skills in Python, ARIMA, and visualization but also gained a deeper appreciation for the challenges and opportunities of working with time-series data. This knowledge positions me to tackle more complex forecasting problems and explore advanced methods like SARIMA or deep learning models for further improvements.
